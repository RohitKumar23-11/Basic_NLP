# Basic_NLP
These two are my first NLP projects. 
First one is a basic project name "NLP_massages" in which I try to detect spam messages where "0" represent non spam message and "1" represent spam message.
I use accuracy, precision, and recall to check the performance of my model. It give very high scores in all of the matrics.
I also check my model with examples for both spam and non spam.
The second project named "NLP Basic Project" will just an overview of NLP that is how it is used and what are it features and tools to done work with NLP projects.
