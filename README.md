# Basic_NLP
This is my first NLP project. It is a basic spam detection project where "0" represent non spam message and "1" represent spam message.
I use accuracy, precision, and recall to check the performance of my model. It give very high scores in all of the matrics.
I also check my model with examples for both spam and non spam.
